# Introduction

## What is Reqnroll ?

Reqnroll was created as a community-maintained, open alternative to SpecFlow when SpecFlow transitioned to a closed-source model.

It is a [Behavior-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) tool for .NET, that allows developers, testers, and business stakeholders to write human-readable [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) that are directly executable against the application code.

At its core, Reqnroll parses `.feature` files written in Gherkin syntax. These files contain scenarios, which describe software behavior using keywords like **Given**, **When**, and **Then**. Each scenario represents an example of how the system should behave in a specific situation. Reqnroll maps these scenarios to [step definitions](xref:Reqnroll.StepDefinitionAttribute) in C# code, allowing automated testing based on real-world specifications.

## Why use Reqnroll ?

Drive development from user requirements

Bridge the gab between requirements and code

Write tests in a language both team and stakeholders understand

Ensure BDD remains accessible and open-source for the .NET ecosystem

Provide full control and visibility into BDD tooling
