  summary: Resolves user created test objects from different scopes (scenario, feature, test thread).
  remarks: >-
    <p>Notes to the implementors:</p>

    <p>

    The test objects might be dependent on particular Reqnroll infrastructure, therefore the implemented

    resolution logic should support resolving the following objects (from the provided Reqnroll container):

    <xref href="Reqnroll.ScenarioContext" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>, <xref href="Reqnroll.FeatureContext" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>, <xref href="Reqnroll.TestThreadContext" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> and

    <xref href="Reqnroll.BoDi.IObjectContainer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> (to be able to resolve any other Reqnroll infrastucture). So basically

    the resolution of these classes has to be forwarded to the original container.

    </p>

    <p>

    If the resolved (top level) object implements <xref href="Reqnroll.Infrastructure.IContainerDependentObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>, the method

    <xref href="Reqnroll.Infrastructure.IContainerDependentObject.SetObjectContainer(Reqnroll.BoDi.IObjectContainer)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> must be called, passing in the original

    Reqnroll container. (The <xref href="Reqnroll.Steps" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> base class needs this.)

    </p>
